# Light & Dark Mode Toggle

- This project showcases a simple and user-friendly Light & Dark Mode system.
Users can switch between light and dark themes instantly, and the website automatically remembers their choice even after refreshing or reopening the page.

## Light Mode

- A bright, clean theme designed for daytime reading and clarity.

## Dark Mode

- A darker theme that reduces eye strain and is ideal for night use.

## Theme Memory

- The website saves the user’s selected mode using local storage.
When the user returns, the same theme is applied automatically.

## Smooth Theme Switching

- The toggle instantly updates text, icons, background colors, and overall UI.

## Purpose of the Project

- The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate:

- How to switch between light and dark themes dynamically

- How to update UI elements such as text, icons, and backgrounds

- How to store and load theme preferences

- How to improve user experience with personalized appearance settings

## How It Works (Conceptual)
